## PHP Stack Conventions

- PHP 8.2+ syntax: constructor promotion, readonly, enums, match.
- `declare(strict_types=1)` in every file.
- Typed properties, parameters, and return types everywhere.
- Composer autoload (PSR-4); never `require` project files by path.
- Exceptions over error returns; never `@` error suppression.
- Pint (or the project formatter) must pass before a change is done.
