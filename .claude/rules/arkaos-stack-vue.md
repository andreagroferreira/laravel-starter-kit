## Vue Stack Conventions

- Composition API only; no Options API.
- `<script setup lang="ts">` in every component.
- Props and emits fully typed (`defineProps`/`defineEmits` generics).
- Shared reactive logic lives in composables, not mixins.
- One component per file; PascalCase filenames.
- v-for always keyed; no index keys on mutable lists.
